    "Q.1 Case Study Description:\n",
    "You are assigned to develop a simple Employee Salary Management System for a company. The system needs to calculate the final salary of an employee based on their basic salary, allowances, and deductions.\n",
    "The company has the following rules:\n",
    "1.\tBasic Salary Calculation:\n",
    "The basic salary of an employee is given. From this, the system will calculate the total salary.\n",
    "2.\tAllowances:\n",
    "o\tHouse Rent Allowance (HRA): 10% of the basic salary\n",
    "o\tMedical Allowance (MA): 5% of the basic salary\n",
    "o\tTransport Allowance (TA): 3% of the basic salary\n",
    "3.\tDeductions:\n",
    "o\tTax Deduction: 12% of the basic salary\n",
    "o\tProvident Fund (PF) Deduction: 5% of the basic salary\n",
    "4.\tFinal Salary Calculation:\n",
    "The final salary will be calculated as:\n",
    "Final Salary=Basic Salary+Total Allowances−Total Deductions\n",
    "The system needs to check whether the final salary is above $5000 or not. If it is, the employee gets a bonus of $200. Otherwise, they don’t get a bonus.\n",
    "Questions Based on the Case Study:\n",
    "1.\tWrite a Python program that takes the basic salary as input and calculates the total allowances and deductions for the employee. The program should also print the allowances (HRA, MA, TA) and deductions (Tax and PF).\n"
